# botlist-updater

A small script that periodically updates the server count of your Discord bot on [top.gg](https://top.gg).

## Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/botlist-updater
```

Then create a file `botlist-updater/config.edn` with the following contents:

```clojure
{:discord-token "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN"
 :dbl-token "YOUR-top.gg-TOKEN"
 :period 5} 
```

Your Discord bot token can be found on its [application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Your top.gg token can be found in the webhooks settings of your bot. The period denotes how many minutes to wait between updates.

When you're done with the configuration, simply run 

```
$ docker-compose up
```

to start the app.
